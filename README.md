## NumberFormat.js

This library was initially a standalone port of the Google Closure NumberFormat implementation
(under the Apache 2 license) by Oliver Wong (@owiber). The library implements most of the
ICU NumberFormat specification.

It handles locale aware number formatting as well as currency formatting.

For the best documentation, you can use the Google Closure docs.

http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/class_goog_i18n_NumberFormat.html

It is now maintained separately from the google project and will only sync bug fixes that apply
to both projects.
